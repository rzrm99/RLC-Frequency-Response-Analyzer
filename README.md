# RLC-Frequency-Response-Analyzer
MATLAB-based tool to analyze the frequency response of Series and Parallel RLC circuits with Bode plots, Nyquist plots, Pole-Zero maps, and key metrics like resonance, bandwidth, and Q-factor.




# RLC Frequency Response Analyzer (MATLAB)

This repository contains MATLAB code for analyzing the frequency response of **Series and Parallel RLC circuits**. It computes and visualizes Bode plots, Nyquist plots, and Pole-Zero maps, and reports key parameters such as Resonant Frequency, Bandwidth, and Q-Factor.

## Features
- Supports both **Series** and **Parallel** RLC configurations.
- Generates:
  - **Bode Magnitude / Phase Plots**
  - **Nyquist Plot**
  - **Pole-Zero Map**
- Calculates key circuit parameters:
  - **Resonant Frequency (f_res)**
  - **Bandwidth (BW)**
  - **Quality Factor (Q)**
